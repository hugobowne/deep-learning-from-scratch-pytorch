    "So we're now going to jump in and build our first machine learning model. It is the (now) famous Titanic dataset, where each row is a passenger on the Titanic and the target variable (the one you're trying to predict) is whether they survived or not. The features (the variables you use to make the prediction) include their name, the fare they paid, where they embarked, **and** their **Sex**. It is an important question whether we want to use this feature. As we're interested in building the best predictive model and *not* putting it into production to make decisions and take actions that impact lives, it may be ok but I encourage you all to interrogate this question further (it is credible that we could build a more accurate model by keeping 'Sex' as a feature as, [on the Titanic](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn22119-sinking-the-titanic-women-and-children-first-myth/), \"the captain explicitly issued an order for women and children to be saved first\").\n",

    "**A note on representation learning:** one of the most important sub-tasks of machine learning is feature engineering. One interesting aspect of deep learning is that neural networks tend to learn features implicitly, as a result of their structure. For example, the more layers a neural network has, the more complex features it can recognise: early layers can identify edges, then then combinations of edges, then corners, the more complex features, and so on. For more on representation learning, check out [\"Representation Learning: A Review and New Perspectives\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5538) by  Bengio et al.\n",

To calculate these slopes, we need use the chain rule from calculus, which is outside the scope of this notebook.

In the next notebook, you'll see how to hand-code backprop using NumPy."
